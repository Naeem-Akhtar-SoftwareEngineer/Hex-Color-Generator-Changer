# Hex-Color-Generator-Changer
A dynamic color generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays a new random HEX color code every time you click a button or refresh the page. It instantly updates both the background color and the displayed HEX code, making it an engaging and simple project that demonstrates JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.
